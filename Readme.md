# Z-TrustChain Prototype

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install ecdsa pycryptodome

2. Run the main script:
   python main.py

## What to Expect

- Generates a DID and keypair
- Demonstrates Shamir secret sharing
- Adds a transaction to a blockchain and mines a block
- Computes access and risk scores
- Enforces a sample policy and prints the result
- Creates and validates a session

This is a minimal demonstration of Z-TrustChain's architecture.
