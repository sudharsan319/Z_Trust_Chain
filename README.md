# Z_Trust_Chain
Z-TrustChain is a Python prototype for zero-trust authentication, merging blockchain, threshold cryptography, and smart contracts to provide decentralized, risk-adaptive, and auditable access control. It eliminates Kerberos vulnerabilities with ephemeral tokens, DIDs, and immutable blockchain-based auditing
